# CompassHeadband
Created as part of a User Experience module for a BSc Computer Science degree at Swansea University.

This project prototype was designed to provide the user with real-time navigation prompts through direcitonal vibration feedback via a wearable headband. This prototype used LEDs to indicate the direction of the next navigation instruction, received via connected smartphone (not implemented in this early demo).

This early prototype for a headband uses 5 LEDs to indicate the direction of a target bearing in relation to a user's head.
